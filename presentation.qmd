## Introduction

-   Survey on a coffee taste test hosted by James Hoffman and Cometeer.

-   4 coffee samples sent to 4,042 Americans. Samples included a light, medium, and dark roast Kenyan coffee and a Columbian coffee.

-   48 questions: favorite sample, what their regular preference is, and what they typically spend on a cup of coffee.

## Exploring the Data

```{r , fig.width = 10}

coffee_survey |>
  filter(!is.na(age)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_relevel(age, c("<18 years old", "18-24 years old", "25-34 years old", "35-44 years old", "45-54 years old", "55-64 years old", ">65 years old")))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "brown") +
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Ages of Coffee Survey Participants")
```

## Excluded Data

```{r , fig.width = 10}

coffee_survey_preference |>
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_relevel(age, c("18-24 years old", "25-34 years old", "35-44 years old", "45-54 years old", "55-64 years old", ">65 years old")))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "brown") +
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Ages of Coffee Survey Participants after Excluding NA Values 
and Particpants Under 18")
```

## Coffee Preference

```{r}

coffee_survey_preference |>
  ggplot(aes(x = prefer_overall)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "brown") +
  labs(x = "Coffee Type",
       y = "Frequency",
       )

```

## Question

**How did bitterness, acidity, and personal preference vary for each coffee sample according to the age of participants?**

## Analaysis

```{r prop bar chart, fig.width = 10}

coffee_survey_preference |>
  mutate(age =  fct_relevel(age, c("18-24 years old", "25-34 years old", "35-44 years old", "45-54 years old", "55-64 years old", ">65 years old"))) |>
  group_by(age, prefer_overall) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, weight = freq, fill = prefer_overall, by = age)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Age", 
       y = "Proportion", 
       title = "Overall Coffee Preference by Age",
       fill = "Coffee Type",
       caption = "Source: The Great American Coffee Taste Test by James Hoffman and Cometeer"
  ) +
  geom_text(stat = "prop", position = position_fill(.5)) +
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

## Analysis

```{r stacked bar graph, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
longer_coffee_survey_preference|>
  mutate(age =  fct_relevel(age, c("18-24 years old", "25-34 years old", "35-44 years old", "45-54 years old", "55-64 years old", ">65 years old"))) |>
  group_by(age, coffee_type, explanatory_type) |> 
  mutate(avg_score = ave(explanatory_value), sd_score = sd(explanatory_value)) |>
  ggplot(aes(fill = factor(age), x = coffee_type, y = avg_score)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(), stat = "identity", color = "black", width = 1) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = avg_score - sd_score, ymax = avg_score + sd_score), width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(1)) + 
  facet_wrap(~explanatory_type) + 
  labs( x = "Coffee Type", 
        y = "Average Score",
        fill = "Age",
        title = "Average Scores for Four Types of Coffee",
        caption = "Source: The Great American Coffee Taste Test by James Hoffman and Cometeer"
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

## Discussion

-   Coffee D had the highest rating for coffee choice overall.

-   Younger people preferred coffee D while older people had an even split between all 4.

-   Acidity and bitterness were generally rated higher amongst younger age groups.
